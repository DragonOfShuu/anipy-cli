## Introduction
If you do not want to see examples and dive directly into the api, please go to the [Code Reference](../reference/index.md) you will find everything you need there, even stuff not covered in the examples! 

You can also check out the code of the [cli](https://github.com/sdaqo/anipy-cli/tree/master/cli/src/anipy_cli) if you want!
## How to read this?
All the important things are covered in the examples, just click through them. I recommend to read the [provider section](examples/provider.md) first!
